After starting this project several other times, I've finally seen it through to completion. As part of FreeCodeCamp's front end libraries certification, I decided to do this challenge with vanilla JS and no frameworks. After implementing this project in both Angular and Vue, I learned quickly how overly complex everthing had become. Not only was there extra steps involved now, but there were loads of unnecessary abstractions.

In the end, this project was simple and easy to implement thanks to the free Quotes on Design API. I had a lot of fun, and although it was simple - I learned a lot about when NOT to use a framework.

Thanks to [Quotes on Design](https://quotesondesign.com/) for the awesome and free API.
